# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I struggled with minor syntax errors. Missing commas, "end", etc.
I am also a little confused about using "=>" vs. ":" in the Hashes. It seems to affect the key naming (using ":" leads to the keys having the colon in the name?).

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
My note-taking is good. I like to type up my notes and use headers to organize them so I can see them and jump around, bold and highlight, use ctrl F, etc. However, I do want to go back and read through them and write out important parts. My most helpful notes are the examples I've written out from the section so that I can look at the syntax.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I usually try to solve the code on my own at first to test my knowledge. Then I use my notes, then Google.
